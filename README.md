This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with vectors and Options. The `bug.rs` file shows code that can panic due to `unwrap()` being called on a potentially `None` value. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to safely handle this scenario using pattern matching or the `expect()` method with a custom error message.  This is a great example of how to avoid panics and write more robust Rust code.
